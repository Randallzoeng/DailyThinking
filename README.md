> "Try to do a project that plays to your strengths. In general, I divide the work of a data scientist into three buckets: Stats, Code, and Storytelling/Visualization. Whichever one of those you’re best at, do a project that highlights that strength. Then, do a project using whichever one of those you’re worst at. This helps you grow, learn something new, and figure out what you need to learn next. Keep going from there" - HILARY MASON
