    "> Let's say we are testing for a rare disease, where 1% of the population is infected. We have a highly sensitive and specific test, which is not quite perfect:\n",
    "- 99% of sick patients test positive.\n",
    "- 99% of healthy patients test negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given that a patient tests positive, what is the probability that the patient is actually sick?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A naive approach to answering this question is this: Imagine we have 100 × 100 = 10,000 perfectly representative people. That would mean that 100 are sick, and 9,900 are healthy. Moreover, after giving all of them the test we'd get 99 sick people testing sick, but 99 healthy people testing sick as well. If you test positive, in other words, you’re equally likely to be healthy or sick; the answer is 50%. "
